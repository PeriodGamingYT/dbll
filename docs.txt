the name "dbll" means DataBase Linked List, as the linked list is a very
core part of the database. note that this document is meant to be read with
the header file as context

DBLL_OK means a function executed successfully
DBLL_ERR means a function didn't execute successfully
"dbll_errno" will be added in the future to further clarify
errors

DBLL_MAGIC_SIZE is the size of "dbll", the magic number used
for dbll files

DBLL_PTR_MAX is how big a pointer can be, any bigger will trigger
an error

DBLL_SIZE_MAX is how big a size can be, mainly used for data size,
any bigger will trigger an error

DBLL_NULL and DBLL_NULL_ERR are 0, but DBLL_NULL_ERR is always returned
when needing to return a DBLL_NULL, this way DBLL_DEBUG can be used to
log where nulls are returned in testing/debug builds of the library

dbll_ptr_t is a representation of a pointer in the file, it's not 
really a pointer to a memory address, more a way to point to blocks
in the file

a block in the file is anything that contains a list, empty slot, or 
data. headers are not blocks and as such, are skipped over when 
calculating where blocks should end up

an index relating to the file is just what byte in a file you want
to access

dbll_file_t is a wrapper for opening the database file, you can have multiple
of them, just have multiple dbll_state_t's (covered later in here). the file
struct contains the memory-mapped file pointer, the size of the file, and the
file descriptor

dbll_file_valid checks if the file struct can be worked on without issues

dbll_file_load will load in a file, only if it exists

dbll_file_unload will unmap the file, close the file, and reset the struct
properties to zero

dbll_file_make will make a file, only if it doesn't exist

dbll_file_resize will change the size of the file, and adjust memory map
of the file accordingly. note that the size changes the file size in bytes, not
blocks, so account for that

dbll_header_t is a wrapper that parses the header of a dbll database file.
it copies information that it contain's and calculates sizes of the header
itself, a list, a empty slot, and a data slot (the of "free" data in it, "free"
meaning data that the user can change and use)

dbll_header_valid will check if the header struct can be worked on without 
issues

dbll_header_load will take in a file, not a state like the rest of them
because the other ones use a state for the file and the header. so we just get
the file and use that instead. otherwise, it just gets the start of the file, 
and loads in the appropriate data, and calculates the appropriate sizes of 
pieces of data found in a dbll database

dbll_header_write will write in data that has changed in dbll_state_t and
update them accordingly, it does this with the empty_slot_ptr

dbll_list_t is a representation of the core datatype in a dbll database, a
a binary tree, with a head and tail. as well a pointer and size variables
about a piece of data. this part of the database was heavily inspired by lisp.
any of the pointers can not directly point to itself

dbll_list_valid checks for a valid list

dbll_list_load will populate a list based on a pointer location in file
memory

dbll_list_unload will set itself to zero

dbll_list_go will go into a dbll lists head or tail (using DBLL_GO_HEAD or 
DBLL_GO_TAIL in list_go_e) and load it's head or tail into the current list

dbll_list_data_index will get the byte of file memory the list data starts
on

dbll_list_data_alloc will allocate brand new data to its data slot. errors if
data is already allocated

dbll_list_data_resize will resize the amount of memory that a list has access 
to, the sizes will be multiples of the list size, also known as a block. new
data will be initalized to zero, old data will be erased and replaced by empty
slots. note that this will overwrite cyclic next pointers, specifically at the 
pointer which first introduces the cycle

dbll_list_write writes its contents into memory, no pointer to itself
needs to be fed as that is already in the struct

dbll_empty_slot_t is a linked list that fills all empty slots, the end of
the empty slot list is allocated to the user whenever the need for such arises.
it holds a pointer to the previous, next, and itself. any pointer can't 
directly point to itself

dbll_empty_slot_valid checks if empty slot is valid

dbll_empty_slot_valid_ptr checks if something in a file at a pointer is a 
valid empty slot

dbll_empty_slot_load will populate a empty slot struct based on pointer 
location in file memory

dbll_empty_slot_unload will set itself to zero

dbll_empty_slot_write will write its contents to memory, note that it does
not need a pointer to where as it already has a pointer to itself (this_ptr).

dbll_empty_slot_clip will clip off an empty slot, it will write this to 
memory. it will handle edge cases with the given states last empty slot

dbll_data_slot_t is the data structure that holds user data. it first has a 
pointer to the next slot, then the rest can by accessed by an index to file 
memory that the user can change. data lists can by cyclic, as in it circles in 
back on itself. the library can handle that appropriately (that's what 
is_marked does). you can not have a data slot point to itself directly, but
you can indirectly.

dbll_data_slot_valid checks if a data slot is valid

dbll_data_slot_load will populate a data slot from a pointer location from file
memory

dbll_data_slot_unload will set itself to zero

dbll_data_slot_next will fetch the next block/page (means same thing in this
context) into the data slot. if next is null, it will return a error

dbll_data_slot_free will mark all of the data slots as free, then unload them
all

dbll_data_slot_page will return a file index from a given page index, which is
a int

dbll_data_slot_resize will resize the amount of data in a data slot, gets rid of
cyclic parts of pointers so they need to be setup again if you do this

dbll_data_slot_alloc will append additional data slots up to given size

dbll_data_slot_write will write a data slot to file memory, note that this will
not affect any of the data the data slot holds, nor does this function write to
it

dbll_data_slot_last will get the pointer to where the last pointer is in a data
slot. if it's cyclic, it will get the pointer where its next pointer points 
back onto itself. more accurately it will walk the linked list until it goes
into a null or a place it has been before. a side effect of this is that if
you don't call dbll_data_slot_last from the beginning of a data slot list, it
might not actually get the last slot in the list if the list is cyclic, depends
on how the list is setup and from which data slot you call it from

dbll_data_slot_cut_end will get rid of some amount of blocks of size provided.
it will know where the end is with dbll_data_slot_last, so keep that in mind.
one thing it does in advance is disconnect the next_ptr on the last block so
that dbll_data_slot_free doesn't free the whole thing

NOTE: dbll_data_slot_write_mem will take memory given by the user and write it into the
data block memory, to be implemented

NOTE: dbll_data_slot_read_mem will take memory in the data slot and write it into the
memory given by the user, to be implemented

dbll_state_t is the data structure that keeps tracks of everything in using
this library. it has where the list starts, and where the last empty slot is.

dbll_state_valid checks if the state is valid

dbll_state_load loads in a state from a file path

dbll_state_unload calls unload on all of its inner components

dbll_state_make makes a file if it can't be found, errors if it is found

dbll_state_replace makes a file if one can't be found, uses the current file
if it is found

dbll_state_alloc will give a pointer to a free pointer in the file memory. it
does this by looking at if there are any empty slots available. if not, it
grows the file

dbll_state_mark_free will take in a memory address and add it to the empty
slot linked list

dbll_state_total_size will get the size of all every blocks in a file

dbll_state_trim will get rid of empty slots at the end of a file, much
like trimming fat off of a piece of steak

dbll_state_compact will get rid of all empty slots and compact the file
in

dbll_ptr_index_copy copies the value of a pointer and copies it into a index
in file memory

dbll_index_ptr_copy copies the value of the file memory at the index given and
copies it into a pointer

dbll_index_to_ptr converts a file memory index into a pointer

dbll_ptr_to_index converts a pointer into an index for file memory
